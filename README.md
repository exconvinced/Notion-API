# Notion-API

This small hobby project demonstrates how to work with databases on Notion via [Notion API Integration](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro).

This Python script utilizes two main functions: extract information from web-scraped data, and read and write information on Notion database with proper API authentication.

Automating this process is a productive way of compiling media onto Notion by batches.
